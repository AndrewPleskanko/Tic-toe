### *I created game board using array char and it looks cool*


>char[][] gameBoard = \
  {{' ', '|', ' ', '|', ' '},\
   {'-', '+', '-', '+', '-'},\
   {' ', '|', ' ', '|', ' '},\
   {'-', '+', '-', '+', '-'},\
   {' ', '|', ' ', '|', ' '}};
   
   P.S. (TicTacToe is my old app that doesn't work properly. UpdateTicTacToe is my finally app that looks cool and works properly)
